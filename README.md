# Shiny Apps

### Description
In this repo I will save & share the data and code used in my shiny apps. 

### Apps
* __check-correlation__: This app allows the user to explore the sample correlation between two normally distributed random variables for different sample sizes. The user then will be able to compare the sample correlation to the truth; the population correlation coefficient - which is defined by the user.
